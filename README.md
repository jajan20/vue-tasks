# VueTasks

Any problems with this, please get in touch. We are more than happy to help you get started if you are unsure of anything :).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` to `IntervieweeTasksVue`
3. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run serve`
4. Visit the site at http://localhost:8080/

# Tasks

## 1. More default data

The project currently has 4 lines of default data in the todo list. Add one more default item, so there are 5 TODO's when you start the application.

## 2. Change the form input

Modify the TODO label so it shows the length of the input as well. 

e.g. 'Test' becomes 'Test (4)', or Netherlands becomes 'Netherlands (11)'

## 3. Display unticked items - Stretch Goal (Bonus Item)

Underneath the list of items, display a list of only UNTICKED items.

## 4. Style It

Provide a basic style. It doesn't need to be too glossy. We just want to see a nicer look/ layout using CSS. You can use external libraries if you wish.
